Pizza Sales Analysis — SQL & Excel Project
Project Overview

This project explores a Pizza Sales dataset to uncover sales performance, customer behaviour, and product insights using SQL and Excel. The analysis is designed to answer key business questions, compute critical KPIs, and provide a foundation for interactive dashboards in Power BI / Tableau.

The goal: turn raw sales data into actionable business insights.

Objectives

Calculate key sales KPIs (Revenue, Orders, AOV, Units Sold, Avg Pizzas/Order).

Analyse sales trends by day of week and time of day.

Break down revenue contribution by pizza category and size.

Identify top 5 best-selling pizzas and bottom 5 slow movers.

Build a framework for dashboard reporting (Excel / Power BI / Tableau).

Tools & Skills Used

SQL (queries, aggregations, filtering, grouping, window functions)

Excel (pivot tables, charting, validation)

Data Analysis Concepts: KPI design, time-series analysis, product mix analysis, Pareto principle (80/20).

Business Intelligence Preparation (dashboard layout & reporting design).

Key KPIs

Total Revenue → Sum of all sales dollars.

Average Order Value (AOV) → Revenue ÷ Orders.

Total Pizzas Sold → Sum of quantity sold.

Total Orders → Unique order IDs.

Average Pizzas per Order → Units ÷ Orders.

Insights

Weekend & evening spikes → Strong demand during dinner and weekends; useful for staffing and promotions.

Top products drive majority of sales → Pareto analysis shows a handful of pizzas dominate revenue.

Large pizzas contribute disproportionately to revenue → clear upsell opportunity from medium to large sizes.

Slow-moving pizzas identified → opportunity for menu optimisation or targeted discounts.
